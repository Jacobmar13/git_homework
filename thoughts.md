1. For success at Turing, I'm going to need to dedicate chunks of time to
  studying and doing homework, in order to build on what we're taught
2. I can look to my fellow cohort for help, and know that we're all here to
  help each other out. I feel like this is going to be a big part of my time
  here at Turing
3. One strategy I'm going to start using is filling out my day and planning my
  day in Google Calendar
4. Another strategy I'll start using is pre-reading lessons to make class's
  easier to follow
